`spotifyradar` is a shiny app that continuously summarizes my listening
habits. I use [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) to upload basic track
information to a Google sheet, which I monitor daily. I use
[spotifyr](https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/) to obtain more metadata
for the tracks and artists I listen to. Then, I summarize everything in
an explorable Shiny app.

In addition to my interest in my own listening habits outside of
Spotify’s end of year summary, I’m using this app as a tool to learn how
to maintain code and data that is updated regularly. In addition, I’m
practicing my SQL skills with data management and extraction.
